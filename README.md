# 1D fluid simulation code (python version)

We have considered simple plasma model, which consist superthermal electron
 and fluid ions. The electrons are model by the Kappa velocity distribution 
and ions are model by the fluid equation (continuity and momentum). Both 
fluids are couple through the poisson's equation.
