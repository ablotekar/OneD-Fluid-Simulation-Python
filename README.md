# 1D fluid simulation code (python version)

## Introduction 
It is python version of the 1D fluid simulation code used in the study of 
ion and electron acoustic solitary wave in the different plasma environment.

To understand the methodology use in the development of code please 
refer [Lotekar et. al., Commun. NonlinearSci. Numer. Simul, 2019](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.07.041)

In the code the module **"fluidplasma"** consist different functions used in
writing code for particular plasma system. 

## Fluid simulation codes 

The fluid simulation codes are written by using the different useful function from
package **"fluidplasma"**. In the following subsections, the information of
of some codes is give. 

### Ion acoustic solitary wave simulation 
In the package script **"ion_acoustic_solitary_wave_two_componunt_plasma.py"** simulate
ion acoustic solitary wave in the plasma which consist of the fluid ion and 
superthermal electron
